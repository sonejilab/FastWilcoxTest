Version: 0.1.3

    person(given = "Stefan",

Description: This package re-implements the Seurat::FindMarkers( test.use == "wilcox" ) 
	but implements all calculation steps in c++. 
	Thereby the function is more than 10 times faster than the Seurat R implementation.
	The c++ wilcox code was extracted from the BioQC BioConductor package.
	It also contains other fast c++ function to interact with sparse matrices.
