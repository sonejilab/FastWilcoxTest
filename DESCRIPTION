Description: Re-implementation the the 'Seurat::FindMarkers'( 'test.use' == "wilcox" ) function 
	but implementing all calculation steps in c++. 
	Thereby the function is more than 10 times faster than the 'Seurat' R implementation.
	The c++ code was extracted from the 'BioQC' 'BioConductor' package.
	It also contains other fast c++ functions to interact with sparse matrices.
