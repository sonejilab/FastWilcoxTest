# 0.1.7

Added the LinLang function to identify genes that show a linear raise over the detection limit in a given grouping.  

# 0.1.5

Added a NormalizeSamples function that simply scales the sparse matrix to a given value per sample.

# 0.1.4

Added a NormalizeCells function that mimics the seurat::RunUMISamplingPerCell function without up sampling.
In addition the function really enforces the usage of exactly nUMI reads per sample.

# 0.1.3

First almost public release.
